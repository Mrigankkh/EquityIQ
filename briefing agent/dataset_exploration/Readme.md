# Dataset Exploration of the FindSum dataset

FINDSum dataset (Financial Report Document Summarization) is a financial summarization benchmark containing thousands of curated document-summary pairs. The documents cover a wide range of financial topics, including earning reports, market outlooks, company announcements, regulatory filings and more. Each document in FINDSum comes with a human-annotated summary making it ideal for supervised finetuning of a summarization model.

We conducted exploratory analysis on the FINDSum dataset to assess its suitability, including an examination of document length distributions (see Figure 3). Based on the datasetâ€™s diversity and length profiles, we determined it to be a strong fit for our use case.
